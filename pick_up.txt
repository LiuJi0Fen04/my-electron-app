4. MessagePorts in electron
    1) setting up a MessageChannel between two renderers
        Why can a message sent to port1 be received by port2?
        * MessageChannel creates a pair of connected ports: port1 and port2.
        * These two ports are like the two ends of a private pipe or tunnel.
        * Any message sent to one port will be received by the other port.
